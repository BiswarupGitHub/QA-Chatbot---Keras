Background,"In 1950,Alan Turing's famous article ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" was published,[12]which proposed what is now called theTuring testas a criterion ofintelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of acomputer programto impersonate a human in areal-timewritten conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest inJoseph Weizenbaum's programELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:"
Background,"In artificial intelligence, machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained, its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures. The observer says to himself ""I could have written that"". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked ""intelligent"", to that reserved for curios. The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be ""explained"". Few programs ever needed it more.[13]"
Background,"ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of the corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').[13]Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses arecapable of being interpretedas ""intelligent""."
Background,"Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a ""friendlier"" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's ""shelf ... reserved for curios"" to that marked ""genuinely useful computational methods""."
Development,"Among the most notable early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) andPARRY(1972).[14][15][16][17]More recent notable programs includeA.L.I.C.E.,Jabberwackyand D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la RechercheandCNRS2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games andweb searchingabilities. In 1984, a book calledThe Policeman's Beard is Half Constructedwas published, allegedly written by the chatbotRacter(though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).[18]"
Development,"From 1978[19]to some time after 1983,[20]the CYRUS project led byJanet Kolodnerconstructed a chatbot simulatingCyrus Vance(57thUnited States Secretary of State). It usedcase-based reasoning, and updated its database daily by parsing wire news fromUnited Press International. The program was unable to process the news items subsequent to the surprise resignation of Cyrus Vance in April 1980, and the team constructed another chatbot simulating his successor,Edmund Muskie.[21][20]"
Development,"One pertinent field of AI research isnatural-language processing. Usually,weak AIfields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses amarkup languagecalled AIML,[3]which is specific to its function as aconversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called,Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based onpattern matchingtechniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would requiresapienceandlogical reasoningabilities."
Development,"Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based onreal-timeuser interactions, rather than being driven from a staticdatabase. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning withevolutionary algorithmsthat optimize their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect,information retrieval."
Development,"Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are theLoebner Prizeand The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).[22]"
Development,"Chatbots may useartificial neural networksas alanguage model. For example,generative pre-trained transformers(GPT), which use thetransformerarchitecture, have become common to build sophisticated chatbots. The ""pre-training"" in its name refers to the initial training process on a largetext corpus, which provides a solid foundation for the model to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of task-specific data. An example of a GPT chatbot isChatGPT.[23]Despite criticism of its accuracy and tendency to “hallucinate”—that is, to confidently output false information and even cite non-existent sources—ChatGPT has gained attention for its detailed responses and historical knowledge. Another example is BioGPT, developed byMicrosoft, which focuses on answeringbiomedicalquestions.[24][25]In November 2023, Amazon announced a new chatbot, called Q, for people to use at work.[26]"
Development,DBpediacreated a chatbot during theGSoCof 2017.[27][28][29]It can communicate throughFacebook Messenger(seeMaster of Code Globalarticle).
Messaging apps,"Many companies' chatbots run onmessaging appsor simply viaSMS. They are used forB2Ccustomer service, sales and marketing.[30]"
Messaging apps,"In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.[31]"
Messaging apps,"Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp. AirlinesKLMandAeroméxicoboth announced their participation in the testing;[32][33][34][35]both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform."
Messaging apps,"The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in agroup chat."
Messaging apps,"Many banks, insurers, media companies, e-commerce companies, airlines, hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities, and restaurant chains have used chatbots toanswer simple questions, increasecustomer engagement,[36]for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.[37]Chatbots are also used inmarket researchto collect short survey responses.[38]"
Messaging apps,"A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.[39]According to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.[40]"
Messaging apps,"Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jenn fromAlaska Airlineswhich debuted in 2008[41]orExpedia's virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011.[41][42]The newer generation of chatbots includesIBM Watson-powered ""Rocky"", introduced in February 2017 by the New York City-basede-commercecompany Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.[43][44]"
Messaging apps,"Used by marketers to script sequences of messages, very similar to anautorespondersequence. Such sequences can be triggered by user opt-in or the use of keywords within user interactions. After a trigger occurs a sequence of messages is delivered until the next anticipated user response. Each user response is used in the decision tree to help the chatbot navigate the response sequences to deliver the correct response message."
Company internal platforms,"Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even inInternet-of-Things(IoT) projects.Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yettime-consumingprocesses when requesting sick leave.[45]Other large companies such asLloyds Banking Group,Royal Bank of Scotland,RenaultandCitroënare now using automated online assistants instead ofcall centreswith humans to provide a first point of contact. ASaaSchatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since theF8Conference whenFacebook’sMark Zuckerbergunveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.[46]In large companies, like in hospitals and aviation organizations, IT architects are designing reference architectures for Intelligent Chatbots that are used to unlock and share knowledge and experience in the organization more efficiently, and reduce the errors in answers from expert service desks significantly.[47]These Intelligent Chatbots make use of all kinds of artificial intelligence like image moderation andnatural-language understanding(NLU),natural-language generation(NLG),machine learningand deep learning."
Customer service,"Chatbots have great potential to serve as an alternate source for customer service.[48]Many high-tech banking organizations are looking to integrate automated AI-based solutions such as chatbots into their customer service in order to provide faster and cheaper assistance to their clients who are becoming increasingly comfortable with technology.  In particular, chatbots can efficiently conduct a dialogue, usually replacing other communication tools such as email, phone, orSMS. In banking, their major application is related to quick customer service answering common requests, as well as transactional support."
Customer service,"Deep learningtechniques can be incorporated into chatbot applications to allow them to map conversations between users and customer service agents, especially in social media.[49]Research has shown that methods incorporating deep learning can learn writing styles from a brand and transfer them to another, promoting the brand's image on social media platforms.[49]Chatbots can create new ways of brands and user interactions, which can help improve the brand's performance and allow users to gain ""social, information, and economic benefits"".[49]"
Customer service,"Several studies report significant reduction in the cost of customer services, expected to lead to billions of dollars of economic savings in the next ten years.[50]In 2019,Gartnerpredicted that by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions globally will be handled completely by AI.[51]A study by Juniper Research in 2019 estimates retail sales resulting from chatbot-based interactions will reach $112 billion by 2023.[52]"
Customer service,"Since 2016, when Facebook allowed businesses to deliver automated customer support, e-commerce guidance, content, and interactive experiences through chatbots, a large variety of chatbots were developed for the Facebook Messenger platform.[53]"
Customer service,"In 2016, Russia-based Tochka Bank launched the world's first Facebook bot for a range of financial services, including a possibility of making payments.[54]"
Customer service,"In July 2016,Barclays Africaalso launched a Facebook chatbot, making it the first bank to do so in Africa.[55]"
Customer service,"The France's third-largest bank by total assets[56]Société Généralelaunched their chatbot called SoBot in March 2018. While 80% of users of the SoBot expressed their satisfaction after having tested it, Société Générale deputy director Bertrand Cozzarolo stated that it will never replace the expertise provided by a human advisor.[57]"
Customer service,"The advantages of using chatbots for customer interactions in banking include cost reduction, financial advice, and 24/7 support.[58][59]"
Healthcare,"Chatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry.[60][61]A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments, locating health clinics, or providing medication information.[62]"
Healthcare,The GPT chatbotChatGPTis able to answer user queries related to health promotion and disease prevention such as screening andvaccination.[63]Whatsapphas teamed up with theWorld Health Organization(WHO) to make a chatbot service that answers users' questions onCOVID-19.[64]
Healthcare,"In 2020,The Indian Governmentlaunched a chatbot called MyGov Corona Helpdesk,[65]that worked through Whatsapp and helped people access information about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.[66][67]"
Healthcare,"Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots. A mixed-methods study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity, the lack of empathy, and concerns about cyber-security.[68]The analysis showed that while 6% had heard of a health chatbot and 3% had experience of using it, 67% perceived themselves as likely to use one within 12 months. The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%), and looking for local health services (80%). However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health."
Healthcare,"The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot. Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots, and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots.[63]"
Politics,"In New Zealand, the chatbot SAM – short forSemantic Analysis Machine[69](made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech[70]) – has been developed. It is designed to share its political thoughts, for example on topics such as climate change, healthcare and education, etc. It talks to people through Facebook Messenger.[71][72][73][74]"
Politics,"In 2022, the chatbot ""Leader Lars"" or ""Leder Lars"" was nominated forThe Synthetic Partyto run in theDanishparliamentary election,[75]and was built by the artist collective Computer Lars.[76]Leader Lars differed from earlier virtual politicians by leading apolitical partyand by not pretending to be an objective candidate.[77]This chatbot engaged in critical discussions on politics with users from around the world.[78]"
Politics,"InIndia, the state government has launched a chatbot for its Aaple Sarkar platform,[79]which provides conversational access to information regarding public services managed.[80][81]"
Government,"Chatbots have been used at different levels of government departments, including local, national and regional contexts. Chatbots are used to provide services like citizenship and immigration, court administrations, financial aid, and migrants’ rights inquiries. For example, EMMA answers more than 500,000 inquiries monthly, regarding services on citizenship and immigration in the US.[82]"
Toys,"Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing, such as toys.[83]"
Toys,"HelloBarbieis an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk,[84]which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.[85]These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.[86]"
Toys,"TheMy Friend Cayladoll was marketed as a line of 18-inch (46 cm) dolls which usesspeech recognitiontechnology in conjunction with anAndroidoriOSmobile app to recognize the child's speech and have a conversation. Like the Hello Barbie doll, it attracted controversy due to vulnerabilities with the doll'sBluetoothstack and its use of data collected from the child's speech."
Toys,"IBM'sWatson computerhas been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such asCogniToys,[83]intended to interact with children for educational purposes.[87]"
Malicious use,"Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fillchat roomswith spam and advertisements by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They were commonly found onYahoo! Messenger,Windows Live Messenger,AOL Instant Messengerand otherinstant messagingprotocols. There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.[88]"
Malicious use,"Tay, an AI chatbot designed to learn from previous interaction, caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter. Soon after its launch, the bot was exploited, and with its ""repeat after me"" capability, it started releasing racist, sexist, and controversial responses to Twitter users.[89]This suggests that although the bot learned effectively from experience, adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse.[90]"
Malicious use,"If a text-sendingalgorithmcan pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot, its message would be more credible. Therefore, human-seeming chatbots with well-crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seems plausible, for instance making false claims during an election. With enough chatbots, it might be even possible to achieve artificialsocial proof.[91][92]"
Data security,"Data securityis one of the major concerns of chatbot technologies. Security threats and system vulnerabilities are weaknesses that are often exploited by malicious users. Storage of user data and past communication, that is highly valuable for training and development of chatbots, can also give rise to security threats.[93]Chatbots operating on third-party networks may be subject to various security issues if owners of the third-party applications have policies regarding user data that differ from those of the chatbot.[93]Security threats can be reduced or prevented by incorporating protective mechanisms. Userauthentication, chatEnd-to-end encryption, and self-destructing messages are some effective solutions to resist potential security threats.[93]"
Limitations of chatbots,"The creation and implementation of chatbots is still a developing area, heavily related toartificial intelligenceandmachine learning, so the provided solutions, while possessing obvious advantages, have some important limitations in terms of functionalities and use cases. However, this is changing over time."
Limitations of chatbots,The most common limitations are listed below:[94]
Chatbots and jobs,"Chatbots are increasingly present in businesses and often are used to automate tasks that do not require skill-based talents. With customer service taking place via messaging apps as well as phone calls, there are growing numbers of use-cases where chatbot deployment gives organizations a clear return on investment.Call centerworkers may be particularly at risk from AI-driven chatbots.[96]"
Chatbots and jobs,Chatbot jobs
Chatbots and jobs,"Chatbot developers create, debug, and maintain applications that automate customer services or other communication processes. Their duties include reviewing and simplifying code when needed. They may also help companies implement bots in their operations."
Chatbots and jobs,A study byForrester(June 2017) predicted that 25% of all jobs would be impacted by AI technologies by 2019.[97]
Chatbots and jobs,"Prompt Engineering, the task of designing and refining prompts (inputs) leading to desired AI-generated responses has gained significant demand and popularity in recent years, with the advent of sophisticated models, notablyOpenAI’s GPT series (which still contain notable flaws and limitations, as previously outlined)."
